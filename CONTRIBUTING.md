# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with Github
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss with the owners of this repository before making a change. To do so, create a new issue.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code, test it for GNOME shell versions <= 44 and >= 45. (If don't know how to do it, don't worry, we can do it for you!)
3. If you've changed behaviour, record a demonstration video or describe what's new.
4. Ensure the other features are still working.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request! ðŸ¥³

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv2 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv2 License](https://github.com/domferr/tilingshell/blob/main/LICENSE) that covers the project.
